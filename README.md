### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Riana Ratna.

I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Information System Degree at Mikroskil University, Indonesia. 

I have a big interest in **_UI/UX_**, **_editing_**, and **_art_**. Right now, I am joining one of Kampus Merdeka Program which is a Certified Independent Study focusing on **_Front-End Web and Back-End_**. Having a great understanding of programming helps me to become a better UI/UX Designer and work as Front-End Developer at any chance.
